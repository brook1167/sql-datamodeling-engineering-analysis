# Background

As a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your primary objective is to investigate the employment records of individuals hired during the 1980s and 1990s. With only six CSV files remaining from that period, your responsibilities include constructing SQL tables to store the CSV data, importing the CSV files into the SQL database, and conducting comprehensive data analysis. This entails designing the SQL queries for importing the CSV data and performing thorough analysis to extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives

### Data Modeling

The first step in this project involves downloading the provided CSV files containing data from Pewlett Hackard. With these files in hand, your task is to design an appropriate database schema by modeling tables that accurately represent the data within the CSV files.
